'''
You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.

There are n packs where the ith pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the ith box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.

Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.

Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.
